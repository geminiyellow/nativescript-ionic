# Io{N}ic Template for NativeScript
A rough approximation of some common styles from the Ionic Framework, adapted for NativeScript.

Based on [Burke Holland's](https://twitter.com/burkeholland) sweet [Nova theme for NativeScript](https://github.com/burkeholland/nativescript-nova).

Just grab the `app.css` file and slap it in the `app` folder of your own project. Docs coming soon.
